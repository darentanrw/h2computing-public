# H2 Computing 9569 Notes

## Using this repository
Hey there, I'm Daren :D, I took the `A Level Computing 9569 Syllabus` in 2021. I struggled a little with the theory side of things, because there weren't really any standardised resource, so I thought that I should open source my notes, and hopefully this repository helps you! If there are any issues / better implementation of code, feel free to open issue requests.

If you found this useful, star the repo!
